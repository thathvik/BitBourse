"""
Utility functions module.

This module is intentionally kept as a placeholder for helper functions
that don't belong to any specific class but are useful across the project.

Examples of functions that might go here:
- Data formatting helpers
- Validation utilities
- Conversion functions
- Any "rogue" helper functions that multiple modules might need

Teaching Note: Having a dedicated utils module from the start is good practice.
It shows students where to put standalone helper functions as the project grows.
